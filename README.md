StringHandoff is used to pass a String from one thread to another. The passer and the receiver meet inside an instance for the handoff. For example, if pass() is called and there is not receiver waiting, the  thread calling pass() will block until the receiver arrives. Similarly,  if receive() is called and there is no passer waiting, the thread calling  receive() will block until the passer arrives.

There can only be one thread waiting to pass at any given time. If a second thread tries to call pass() when another thread is already waiting to pass, an IllegalStateException is thrown. Similarly, there can only be one thread waiting to receive at any given time. If a second thread tries to call receive() when another thread is already waiting to receive, an IllegalStateException is thrown. IllegalStateException is a RuntimeException.

Methods that take a timeout parameter will throw a TimedOutException if the specified number of milliseconds passes without the handoff occurring. TimedOutException is a RuntimeException.

The methods that declare that they may throw a ShutdownException will do so after shutdown() has been called. If a thread is waiting inside a method and another thread calls shutdown(), then the waiting thread will throw a ShutdownException. If a thread calls a method that declares that it may throw a ShutdownException, and any thread has already called shutdown(), then the call will immediately throw the ShutdownException. ShutdownException is a RuntimeException.
